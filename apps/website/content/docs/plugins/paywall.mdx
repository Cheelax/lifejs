The idea here, is to add a paywall, inside of your agent. Not before, not after, during the agent.

Let's say that by default, in your application every new user is given 100 minute credits of discussion.

And that after this delay, you want to prompt the user to pay for more credits.

You could have triggered an agent hangup and added a paywall popup, but a more engaging way to do it could be to have the agent itself saying something like: "I see that you have 5 minutes credits left, I would have loved to continue that conversation but it seems that we won't have enough time. Are you ready to subcribe?".

And then if the user says "yes", enter a flow where the user can pay for more credits.

But more importantly, prevent the user from continuing the conversation without paying.
